Here’s a detailed breakdown of the process of sending an email with a document that is both *digitally signed* and *encrypted*, using the sender's and recipient's public and private keys.

 1. Digital Signing the Document (Sender's Actions)

   - Hash the Document: The sender creates a hash (digest) of the document using a hashing algorithm (e.g., SHA-256).
   - Sign the Hash: The sender encrypts this hash using their private key. This creates the *digital signature*, which ensures the document's authenticity (verifying it came from the sender) and integrity (ensuring it hasn’t been modified).
   - Attach the Signature: The sender attaches the digital signature to the original document. Now the document is “signed.”

 2. Encrypting the Document and Signature (Sender's Actions)

   - Generate a Symmetric Key: The sender generates a random symmetric key (e.g., AES) to encrypt the document with the attached digital signature.
   - Encrypt the Document and Signature: Using the symmetric key, the sender encrypts the entire signed document. This encrypted form protects the document’s confidentiality, making it unreadable to anyone without the symmetric key.

 3. Encrypting the Symmetric Key (Sender's Actions)

   - Encrypt with Recipient’s Public Key: The sender uses the recipient’s public key to encrypt the symmetric key. Only the recipient can decrypt this symmetric key using their private key.
   - Attach Encrypted Symmetric Key: The sender attaches this encrypted symmetric key to the encrypted document and sends both in the email.

At this point, the email sent to the recipient contains:
   - The encrypted document (with the digital signature attached).
   - The encrypted symmetric key (encrypted with the recipient’s public key).

 4. Decrypting and Accessing the Document (Recipient's Actions)

Upon receiving the email, the recipient performs these steps:

   - Decrypt the Symmetric Key: The recipient uses their private key to decrypt the symmetric key. This key will allow them to decrypt the document itself.
   - Decrypt the Document: Using the now-decrypted symmetric key, the recipient decrypts the document, revealing the signed original document and its digital signature.

 5. Verifying the Digital Signature (Recipient’s Actions)

   - Decrypt the Signature: The recipient uses the sender’s public key to decrypt the digital signature, revealing the original hash that was created by the sender.
   - Re-Hash the Document: The recipient hashes the decrypted document (excluding the signature).
   - Compare Hashes: If the hash generated by the recipient matches the decrypted hash from the digital signature, the document’s authenticity and integrity are confirmed.

 Summary of Security Guarantees

- Confidentiality: The document is encrypted, so only the intended recipient, with the correct private key, can decrypt and read it.
- Authenticity: The sender’s digital signature confirms that the document was indeed sent by the claimed sender.
- Integrity: The digital signature verifies that the document has not been altered in transit.

This process ensures both the confidentiality and authenticity of sensitive communications, making it ideal for secure email exchanges in systems like PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) or S/MIME.
